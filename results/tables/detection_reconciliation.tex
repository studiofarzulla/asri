\paragraph{Reconciling Detection Rate Discrepancies.}
The apparent discrepancy between threshold-based detection (3/4 events) and event study
significance (4/4 events) reflects methodological differences rather than inconsistent data.
The Terra/Luna collapse peak of 48.7 falls below the operational threshold
of 50 but exhibits highly significant abnormal elevation ($t = 5.47$,
$p < 0.001$), indicating that ASRI detected \textit{some} stress buildup even though the
level remained below the alert threshold. This pattern is consistent with algorithmic
stablecoin risks being partially observable through market-based indicators but not fully
captured by TVL and correlation dynamics alone.

For operational purposes, practitioners should interpret ASRI $\geq 50$ as \textit{actionable
alerts} while recognizing that statistically significant deviations below this threshold
(as in Terra/Luna) warrant heightened monitoring. The walk-forward validation achieves 4/4
detection because out-of-sample thresholds are calibrated relative to pre-crisis baselines,
which were lower during early 2022 than the fixed operational threshold.
